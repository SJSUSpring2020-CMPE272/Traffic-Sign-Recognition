1. Unite App
•	Description:  A responsive app to plan personalized event/party/meetings with a group of your closest friends meeting all their individual preferences based on location, type of restaurants, distance, etc.
o	The app will have mainly the following features: 
	Add friends - Invite them using just a unique code
	Suggest restaurants/places/events based on locations/time/personal preferences
	Share the live location of friends to co-ordinate or for safety
	AI-based recommendations on places using profiles of people attending
•	Goal: In modern cities, arranging an event or even a simple get together for a group of friends/people can be difficult tasks due to the issue of logistics involved like availability of person, time, location, the distance involved from different individuals and coordination for traveling. This app is focused on solving that problem and making it convenient for people to arrange anything.
o	Business Perspective: Can be monetized by adding paid restaurant or events ads based on preferences
•	Technology Stack: Maps API(Google/Open Source), Web Technologies - HTML5/React, Database - MySQL/MongoDB
 
 
 
2. The Recipe Chef
•	Description: Web app to suggest recipe based on the image of available ingredients uploaded including cooking methods
•	Goal:  The app aims to increase convenience for users while cooking by providing them a recipe easily without them searching using specific ingredients. While cooking based on ingredients is easy, most of the time a person won’t have all the items required for cooking said recipe. This app aims to solve that problem.
o	The user will upload the image(s) of all available items to the app
o	The app will analyze the image using IBM Image Recognition API and provide ingredients
o	Using smart search, multiple recipes with video or links will be suggested to the user closing matching to the ingredients and cooking methods involved
•	Technology Stack:  Image Recognition API, Web Technology - HTML5/React, Database - MySQL/MongoDB



3. Personalized Home Finder
•	Description: Web app which recommends apartments based on personal preferences.
•	Goal: In today’s busy lives it can be challenging to find a perfect home that satisfies all your needs especially when you are moving to a whole new city. App provides a platform for renters to mention all their needs through a series of question-answers like location, commute preferences, proximity to workplace/schools/markets/hospitals, budget, amenities, etc. The app provides lists of matching apartments based on priorities of the above needs and how flexible the renter wishes to be. The app can also predict location-specific rent trends and a possible fluctuation in rent based on historical data.
•	Technology stack: Python, TensorFlow, Machine Learning Models, Maps API
 
 
 
4. Traffic Sign Recognition using Machine Learning Models
•	Description: There are several different types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc. Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to and building a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. The datasets from each class are used to train the algorithm. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.
•	Goal: Detecting and recognizing emerging traffic for the smooth functioning of autonomous vehicles
•	Technology Stack: Image Classification, Python, Keras, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Machine Learning Model (CNN)
